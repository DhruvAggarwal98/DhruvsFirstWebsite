<h2>Projects:</h2>
<h4>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) : Precision Algorithm for Takeoff and Landing <div style="text-align:right;"> Jan 2018 - Present </div> </h4>
•	Developed an autopilot algorithm on MATLAB for takeoff and landing of an UAV
<br>•	Identified waypoints and targets for testing the algorithm in complex scenarios
<br>•	Simulated and tested the algorithm on X-Plane to assess real time compatibility and avoid overload 

<br><h4>Data Analytics & Data Cleansing : Linear plotting of complex Thermocouple Data                    Mar 2017 – May 2017</h4>
•	Developed a data cleansing algorithm on MATLAB to cleanse two sets of Thermocouple data of 10,000 data points each in MS Excel
<br>•	Analyzed linear plots of each thermocouple to compare critical metrics and identify the most efficient thermocouple  
<br>•	Wrote a technical brief (MS Word) on critical findings and presented (MS PowerPoint) the summary to the participating teams 

<br><h4>Solar Energy and Environment Sustainability:  Generate Solar Power using car batteries         Nov 2016 – Dec 2016</h4>
•	Conducted an in depth analysis of over 50 potential solutions to improve environmental sustainability, and identified the final solution based on feasibility, cost, availability of resources and additional complexities
<br>•	Researched extensively on existing solar technology and its effects on environmental sustainability
<br>•	Designed an end to end process to extract lead in perovskite cells from car batteries and use it to generate solar power
<br>•	Identified potential challenges and milestones and presented findings to the participating teams 

<br><h4>Solar Energy and Statistics : Least Cost Solution for solar panel placement (Winner)  Sep 2016 – Nov 2016 </h4>
•	Built the most efficient house compared to all participants which met the stated constraints by producing maximum energy, consuming least, while reducing cost
<br>•	Identified key drivers to energy conservation and production e.g., sun position, wall / window thickness, architectural constraints, floors, tree positioning, number of occupants, seasons, temperature control etc. 
<br>•	Conducted over 100 build scenarios and tested each with different parameters to arrive at the final solution
<br>•	Identified the equation with key variables and used statistics to calculate and test solutions
